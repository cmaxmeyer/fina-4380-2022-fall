# Introduction

Welcome to FINA 4380 for Fall 2022!

## Website

I will maintain all our notebooks on this website because Canvas does not render notebooks.
This website makes it easy to view our notebooks without downloading them and opening them in JupyterLab.
Still, you can download our notebooks by clicking the down arrow in the upper-right corner of every notebook page.
We will walk through these notebooks in class, adding notes and examples, and I will update these notebooks and this website after class.
I will maintain *everything else* (e.g., syllabus, project assignments, and grades) on our Canvas website.

The McKinney section has one notebook per chapter we will cover in {cite:t}`mckinney2018python`.
Likewise, the Lewinson section has one notebook per chapter we will cover in {cite:t}`lewinson2020python`.
As the semester progresses, I will add a Herron section with *ad hoc* notebooks from class discussions, and a project section with template notebooks.

## GitHub Repository
